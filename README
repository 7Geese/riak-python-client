  The protocol buffers transport uses a module generated from riakclient.proto.
  This repo includes the generated code, however if changes are made to the
  .proto file (which must match client/server), make sure you have protoc
  installed from http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ and regenerate the
  riakclient_pb2.py file with
  
    make pb
